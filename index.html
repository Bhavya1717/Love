						<p>Nidhi First Meet</p>
					</div>
					<div class="bottom-content">
						<span>-⟩ It was around eight years ago when I crossed paths with Nidhi, a distant relation
							through
							a complex family connection. Instantly, I found myself enamored by her presence. She was
							just five months younger than me, but her allure was magnetic. However, the familial ties
							made any possibility of a relationship seemingly implausible. <br><br>
							-⟩ Being too bashful and intimidated by Nidhi's striking charm and confident demeanor, I
							hesitated to confess my feelings. Time slipped by, and as I pursued my college education, I
							learned the art of conversing with others, especially with girls, thanks to my friends'
							guidance.

						<p>Nidhi First Propose</p>
					</div>
					<div class="bottom-content">
						<span>By the end of the second semester in July 2023, I summoned the courage to finally profess
							my feelings to Nidhi. Her response was gentle yet firm, stating that our familial ties made
							a romantic relationship unfeasible. Initially distraught, I lied, claiming it was a prank
							played by my friend. But eventually, I confessed my true feelings, persistently hoping for a
							different response. Despite my efforts, her answer remained unchanged.

						<p>Unveiling Unspoken Affections</p>
					</div>
					<div class="bottom-content">
						<span>Nidhi, a kind and perfect soul, continued to communicate with me, albeit strictly in a
							platonic sense. Our bond evolved into a close friendship, but it was during this time that I
							noticed a mutual social media acquaintance showing interest in her.
							<br><br>
							I confronted Nidhi about this, and after some reluctance, she unveiled that he was her
							ex-boyfriend, the one she still loved deeply. They had shared moments of daily devotion,
							visiting temples, and even exchanging kisses. Their separation had been a result of familial
							disapproval, particularly from the guy's mother.
							<br><br>
							Nidhi's promise to herself—never to fall in love before marriage—weighed heavily on her
							conscience, as she believed she was breaking that vow by entertaining my affection. Her
							loyalty and dedication to her initial promise led her to reject my advances.
							<br><br>
							Despite feeling shattered, I forgave her for her predicament, understanding her unwavering
							commitment to her principles. Her integrity and loyalty were unparalleled, preventing her
							from entertaining any romantic feelings for me. Nonetheless, she insisted on maintaining our
							friendship.
							<br><br>
							Aware of the toll this took on me, my sister, recognizing my love for Nidhi, encouraged me
							to distance myself, urging me to focus on personal aspirations. Nidhi, being the person she
							was, bid me a final goodbye on November 5th, 2023, at 9:52 pm, acknowledging the pain it
							caused her as well.
